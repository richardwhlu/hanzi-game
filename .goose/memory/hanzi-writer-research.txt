# javascript chinese-characters stroke-tracking learning-analytics
Hanzi Writer Library Research Summary - This library focuses primarily on stroke order practice rather than comprehensive learning analytics. Key findings:
1. Limited built-in proficiency system - only basic mistake counting
2. No built-in leveling or progression tracking
3. Event callbacks: onMistake, onCorrectStroke, onComplete
4. Custom stroke evaluation via leniency and other parameters
5. StrokeData provides: character, strokeNum, mistakesOnStroke, totalMistakes, strokesRemaining, drawnPath, isBackwards
6. Main evaluation criteria: distance threshold, shape matching, direction matching, length matching
7. Developers must build their own analytics on top of the basic tracking
