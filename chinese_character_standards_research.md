## 6. Comparative Analysis of Standards

### Character Count Progression Comparison

| Level/Grade | HSK New | TOCFL | PRC Education | IB Chinese B |
|-------------|---------|-------|---------------|--------------|
| Beginner    | 300     | 400   | 300 (Gr 1)   | 600-800      |
| Elementary  | 600     | 800   | 600 (Gr 3)   | 1,000-1,500  |

| Advanced    | 1,800   | 3,000+| 3,500 (HS)   | 2,000-3,000  |

### Common Progression Patterns
1. **Rapid initial growth:** 300-600 characters in first levels
2. **Steady progression:** ~300-400 character increases per level
3. **Plateau effect:** Diminishing returns at advanced levels
4. **Recognition vs. Production:** Higher recognition than writing requirements

## 8. Mapping Between Different Standard Systems

### Approximate Equivalencies

**Beginner Level:**
- HSK 1-2 ≈ TOCFL A1-A2 ≈ PRC Grade 1-3 ≈ IB ab initio

**Intermediate Level:**
- HSK 3-4 ≈ TOCFL B1-B2 ≈ PRC Grade 4-6 ≈ IB Chinese B (SL)

**Advanced Level:**
- HSK 5-6 ≈ TOCFL C1-C2 ≈ PRC Junior High ≈ IB Chinese B (HL)

**Near-Native Level:**
- HSK 7-9 ≈ PRC Senior High ≈ IB Chinese A ≈ University entrance level

### Character Overlap Analysis
- **Core 1,000 characters:** ~95% overlap across all systems
- **Next 1,000 characters:** ~80% overlap
- **Beyond 2,000 characters:** ~60% overlap (more specialized vocabulary)

### System-Specific Focus Areas
- **HSK:** Business and academic Chinese
- **TOCFL:** Daily life and cultural Chinese
- **PRC Education:** Literary and cultural Chinese
- **IB:** Academic and analytical Chinese

## Key Findings

1. **Convergence at basic levels:** All systems require similar foundational characters
2. **Divergence at advanced levels:** Different systems emphasize different character sets
3. **Recognition vs. production gap:** Most systems require higher recognition than production
4. **Cultural variations:** Mainland vs. Taiwan standards show some differences
5. **Regular updates:** Standards are periodically revised to reflect language evolution

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Download official character lists from each organization
2. Create digital mappings between systems
3. Analyze character frequency data
4. Develop progression pathways for different learning goals
5. Consider regional variations (Simplified vs. Traditional characters)
